    "# Lab Task: Forward Bank Bills and Enhanced Yield Curve Bootstrap #\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will extend the existing class structure to handle **forward-starting bank bills** and build a yield curve that can bootstrap using these forward instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Forward Bank Bills\n",
    "\n",
    "A **forward bank bill** is a contract made today to purchase a bank bill at a future date. Unlike a regular bank bill that starts today, a forward bank bill:\n",
    "- Has a **start date** in the future\n",
    "- Has a **maturity date** beyond the start date  \n",
    "- Allows market participants to lock in rates for future periods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"3-month bank bill starting in 6 months\" (denoted as a 6x9 forward):\n",
    "- You agree today to a price\n",
    "- In 6 months (start date), you pay that price\n",
    "- In 9 months (maturity), you receive the face value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cash Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "A forward bank bill has two key dates:\n",
    "1. **Start date**: The date when you pay the price (negative cash flow)\n",
    "2. **Maturity date**: The date when you receive the face value (positive cash flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Forward Bills Matter for Yield Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward bank bills provide information about **implied forward rates** between two future points in time. By including them in the reference portfolio, we can:\n",
    "- Build a more complete yield curve\n",
    "- Extract market expectations about future interest rates\n",
    "- Improve interpolation between sparse maturity points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Tasks Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "1. Create a `Forward_bank_bill` class that inherits from `Bank_bill`\n",
    "2. Create a `YieldCurve_with_forward_bills` class that inherits from `YieldCurve` \n",
    "3. Update the bootstrap method to handle forward-starting instruments\n",
    "4. Instantiate a portfolio with both spot and forward instruments\n",
    "5. Build a yield curve and test it with a set of cash flows\n",

    "### Step 1: Create the Forward_bank_bill Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new class `Forward_bank_bill` that inherits from `Bank_bill` with the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Add a `start_date` parameter to the `__init__` method (in addition to the existing Bank_bill parameters)\n",
    "- The `maturity` parameter should represent the total time from now to final maturity\n",
    "- The `start_date` represents the time from now to when the bill starts\n",
    "- Override the `set_cash_flows()` method to create cash flows at:\n",
    "  - `start_date`: negative cash flow equal to `-price`\n",
    "  - `maturity`: positive cash flow equal to `face_value`\n",
    "- Add getter methods for `start_date` and the forward period (`maturity - start_date`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use `super().__init__()` to call the parent class constructor\n",
    "- For a forward bill, the pricing relationship involves both the start and maturity dates\n",
    "- The forward rate can be calculated from the price and the forward period\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage (after implementation):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A 3-month bill starting in 6 months (6x9 forward)\n",
    "fwd_bill = Forward_bank_bill(face_value=100, start_date=0.5, maturity=0.75)\n",
    "fwd_bill.set_ytm(0.04)  # 4% forward rate\n",

    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Override the `bootstrap()` method to handle forward bank bills\n",
    "2. The method should:\n",
    "   - Start by calling `self.add_zero_rate(0, 0)` to set the discount factor at time 0\n",
    "   - Process regular (spot) bank bills first, in order of maturity\n",
    "     - For each spot bill: extract the discount factor at its maturity\n",
    "   - Process forward bank bills next, in order of their maturity (not start date)\n",
    "     - For each forward bill: use the known discount factor at the start date and the bill's pricing to solve for the discount factor at the maturity date\n",
    "   - Process bonds last, in order of maturity\n",
    "     - For each bond: use all previously determined discount factors to value intermediate coupons, then solve for the discount factor at the bond's maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight for Forward Bills:**\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "$$DF(t_2) = \\frac{P}{F} \\cdot DF(t_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- You'll need to distinguish between regular bank bills and forward bank bills\n",
    "- Use `isinstance(bill, Forward_bank_bill)` to check if an instrument is a forward bill\n",
    "- You can access the portfolio's bank bills with `self.portfolio.get_bank_bills()`\n",
    "- For forward bills, you'll need to call `get_discount_factor(start_date)` from the curve\n",

    "1. **Forward Rate Interpretation**: Compare the YTMs of the regular 3-month bill (3.0%) with the forward bills (3.2%, 3.4%, 3.6%). What does this tell you about the market's expectation of future interest rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Discount Factor Pattern**: Look at your discount factors. Do they decrease as maturity increases? Why is this expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Rate Curve Shape**: Plot or examine the zero rates from 0.25 to 2.0 years. Is the curve upward sloping, downward sloping, or flat? What does this imply about the term structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpolation**: The cash flow at 1.5 years requires interpolation. What interpolation method does the ZeroCurve class use? (Hint: check the `get_discount_factor()` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bootstrap Order**: Why is it important to process the instruments in order of maturity when bootstrapping? What would go wrong if you tried to process the 2-year bond before all the shorter-maturity instruments?"

    "- ✅ Built a complete yield curve from a mixed portfolio of spot and forward instruments\n",
    "- ✅ Tested the curve by valuing a set of cash flows\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Forward instruments provide information about market expectations of future rates\n",
    "- The bootstrap method must be carefully sequenced to build up the curve progressively\n",
    "- Interpolation allows us to value cash flows at dates not in the reference portfolio\n",
    "- The yield curve is a fundamental tool for pricing fixed-income securities\n",
