    "# Lab Task: Create a Yield Curve Hedge Method #\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will extend the `YieldCurve` class to add a sophisticated hedging capability that calculates hedge positions to offset interest rate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Interest Rate Risk and Hedging\n",
    "\n",
    "When holding fixed-income positions, changes in interest rates affect their value. **Hedging** is the practice of taking offsetting positions to reduce this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delta Hedging**: Calculating sensitivity to small changes in market rates and taking offsetting positions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yield Curve Risk**: Different instruments are sensitive to different parts of the yield curve (short-term vs long-term rates)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hedge Portfolio**: A portfolio of liquid instruments (the reference instruments used to build the curve) that can offset the risk of a position\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bumping Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate hedge ratios, we use a technique called **bumping**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the base NPV of the position using the current yield curve\n",
    "2. For each instrument in the reference portfolio:\n",
    "   - Bump its yield by a small amount (e.g., 1 basis point = 0.0001)\n",
    "   - Recalculate the cash flows for that instrument\n",
    "   - Rebuild the yield curve using the bootstrap method\n",
    "   - Recalculate the NPV of the position\n",
    "   - Calculate the change in NPV: $\\Delta NPV = NPV_{bumped} - NPV_{base}$\n",
    "3. The hedge ratio for each instrument is: \n",
    "   $$\\text{Hedge Ratio} = -\\frac{\\Delta NPV_{position}}{\\Delta NPV_{hedge\\_instrument}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each reference instrument affects a specific part of the yield curve\n",
    "- By bumping each instrument, we measure how sensitive our position is to changes in different maturities\n",
    "- The hedge ratios tell us how much of each reference instrument to hold to offset our position's risk\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a new method `calculate_hedge()` for the `YieldCurve` class that:\n",
    "1. Takes a position (any instrument object) as input\n",
    "2. Calculates hedge ratios for each instrument in the reference portfolio\n",
    "3. Returns a hedge portfolio with appropriate positions\n",

    "        hedge_details: A dictionary with detailed hedge information\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate base NPV of the position using the current curve\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each bank bill in the reference portfolio:\n",
    "   - Create a copy of the bill\n",
    "   - Bump its YTM by bump_size\n",
    "   - Recalculate its cash flows\n",
    "   - Create a new YieldCurve with this bumped bill (keeping other instruments the same)\n",
    "   - Bootstrap the new curve\n",

    "   - Calculate delta NPV: `delta_npv = new_npv - base_npv`\n",
    "   - Also calculate the change in value of the bumped bill itself\n",
    "   - Calculate hedge ratio: `-delta_npv_position / delta_value_bill`\n",
