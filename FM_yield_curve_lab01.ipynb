    "# Lab Task: Create a Corporate Bond Class #\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this lab, you will extend the Bond class to create a Corporate Bond class that models credit risk through a credit spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by companies (rather than governments). Because companies have credit risk (the possibility of default), corporate bonds trade at higher yields than equivalent government bonds. The difference in yield is called the **credit spread**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept**: \n",
    "$$\\text{Corporate Bond Yield} = \\text{Reference Bond Yield} + \\text{Credit Spread}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Reference Bond**: A government bond (risk-free benchmark) with similar characteristics\n",
    "- **Credit Spread**: Additional yield demanded by investors to compensate for credit risk\n",
    "- **Corporate Bond Yield**: The total yield of the corporate bond\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Import Required Classes\n",
    "Import the existing instrument classes we'll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create Reference Bonds\n",
    "Create government bonds that will serve as risk-free benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Design the CorporateBond Class\n",
    "Create a new class that:\n",
    "- **Inherits from** the Bond class (demonstrating inheritance)\n",
    "- Adds a `credit_spread` attribute (e.g., 0.02 for 200 basis points)\n",
    "- Adds a `reference_bond` attribute (link to the benchmark government bond)\n",
    "- Overrides the yield calculation to include the credit spread\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create and Test Corporate Bonds\n",
    "Instantiate corporate bonds and verify that their yields correctly reflect the credit spread over the reference bonds.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance**: Your class should inherit from Bond\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CorporateBond(Bond):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **New Attributes**: Add two new attributes in the `__init__` method:\n",
    "   - `self.credit_spread` (initialize to 0.0)\n",
    "   - `self.reference_bond` (initialize to None)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setter Methods**: Create methods to set these attributes:\n",
    "   - `set_credit_spread(spread)`: Sets the credit spread\n",
    "   - `set_reference_bond(bond)`: Sets the reference government bond\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Override set_ytm()**: Create a method that automatically calculates the corporate bond's YTM as:\n",
    "   - Reference bond YTM + Credit spread\n",
    "   - This method should call the parent class's `set_ytm()` with the calculated value\n",
    "   - Hint: Use `super().set_ytm(calculated_ytm)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Remember to call `super().__init__()` in your `__init__` method to initialize the parent Bond class\n",
    "- You're extending the Bond class, not replacing it - all Bond methods should still work\n",
    "- Think about what happens if someone tries to set YTM before setting the reference bond"

    "After completing this lab, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance**: How did inheriting from the Bond class make your work easier? What functionality did you get \"for free\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**: How does the `set_ytm()` method in your CorporateBond class encapsulate the logic of adding the credit spread? Why is this better than manually calculating it each time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-world application**: In practice, credit spreads change over time based on market conditions and company performance. How might you extend this class to handle time-varying credit spreads?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Since CorporateBond inherits from Bond, can you use it anywhere a Bond is expected? Try passing a CorporateBond to the `npv()` method of a ZeroCurve object."
